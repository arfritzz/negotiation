(* first attempt at a refinement tree *)

(* What are the layers of the refinement tree? 

target identity 
      |
      |
system components 
      |
      |
primitive operations 

At first glance, maybe these are the layers. The question is what occurs with more complex measurements? What would then be the next layer?
