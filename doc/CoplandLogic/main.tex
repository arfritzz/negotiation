\section{Selection Policy}

Prior to this, we assumed that an appraiser would apply their selection policy to generate the best term for attestation. However, in our first attempt at negotiation, the selection policy was hollow and insignificant. It was simply applied as a proof of concept. However, now we consider ways to order protocols such that the selection policy may arrive at teh ``best'' protocol for attestation. 

\subsection{Refinement trees}

One way to enforce an ordering over protocols may be with a refinement tree.
